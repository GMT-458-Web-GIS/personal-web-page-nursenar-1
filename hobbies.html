        <h3>🧶 Crochet</h3>
        <p>
          Crochet is therapy for me! Creating something by hand fulfills me and makes me feel productive. 
          And I share it as much as I can on my social media accounts. Here are a few examples for you.

        <h3>🏸 Badminton</h3>
        <p>
          One of my favorite sports activities is badminton. Because it requires both reflexes and concentration, 
          it keeps me mentally sharp. I also participated in and performed at my university's sports festivals. 
          I competed solo on the Engineering Faculty Women's Team in 2022, placing third, competing with my team in 2024, and fourth in 2025.

        <h3>🥾 Hiking</h3>
        <p>
          I love being surrounded by nature. Hiking, exploring new places, and getting fresh air bring me peace.
