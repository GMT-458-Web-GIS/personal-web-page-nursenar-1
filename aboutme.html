        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Hatice Nursena ResÃ¼loÄŸlu.
I was born on July 21, 2001, in Kastamonu, a small city located in the western Black Sea region. I began my education there. In 2019, I completed my high school education at Kastamonu GÃ¶l Anatolian High School and was placed in my first choice, Hacettepe University's Geomatics Engineering program. I'm currently a senior. I completed various internships and participated in projects related to my department, which further fueled my interest in the field. 
My areas of interest in the department include geographic information systems, 3D modeling, and the changes brought about by the recent rise of artificial intelligence in the mapping industry.
At university, I also joined and participated in community organizations to improve myself and gain social experience. For example, I was a member of the audit committee of the Geospatial Information Society for a while, and during the 2024-2025 academic year, I was a member of the Hacettepe University Knitting and Handicrafts Society (HUCROT).
In general, I love eating, drinking, having fun with friends and family, traveling, and exploring. One of the things I enjoy most is knitting! It makes me feel relaxed and productive. My top future goals include completing my undergraduate degree and starting my own business. For long-term careers, I think I need to gain a little more experience.
